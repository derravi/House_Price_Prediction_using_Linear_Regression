# House_Price_Prediction_using_Linear_Regression
<b> machine learning project that predicts house prices based on area, bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, and year built using Linear Regression. Includes model evaluation metrics, data visualization, and interactive price prediction.

This project demonstrates how to predict house prices using machine learning with Linear Regression. The dataset includes features like area in square feet, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of floors, and year built.
