<b>House Price Prediction using Linear Regression</b>

A machine learning project that predicts house prices based on area, bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, and year built using Linear Regression. It includes model evaluation metrics, data visualization, and interactive price prediction.

This project demonstrates how to predict house prices using machine learning with Linear Regression. The dataset includes features like area in square feet, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of floors, and year built.

<b>Project Workflow</b>

Load and explore the dataset

Handle missing values and describe the dataset

Train a Linear Regression model

Evaluate performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R2 score

Visualize data with histograms and scatter plots

Predict house price interactively based on user input

<br>

<b>Files included</b>

house_data.csv contains the dataset

house_price_prediction.py contains data preprocessing, model training, visualization, and prediction code

README.md explains the project details

<b>How to run the project</b>

<b>Option 1 Run directly in Python</b>

Install the required Python libraries pandas, numpy, scikit learn, matplotlib

Run the script house_price_prediction.py

Enter house details when prompted to get the predicted price

<br>

<b>Option 2 Run in Jupyter Notebook</b>

Install Jupyter Notebook if not already installed using pip install notebook

Open terminal or command prompt and type jupyter notebook

In the browser interface, navigate to your project folder

Open the script file or create a new notebook and paste the code

Run cells step by step to train the model, visualize data, and make predictions
